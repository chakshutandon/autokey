s ago there was an emperor who was so excessively fond of new clothes that he spent all his money in dress he did not trouble himself in the least about his soldiers nor did he care togo either to the theatre or the chase except for the opportunities then afforded him for displaying his new clothes he had a different suit for each hour of the day and as of any other king or emperor one is accustomed to say he is sitting in council it was always said of him the emperor is sitting in his wardrobe makeover
